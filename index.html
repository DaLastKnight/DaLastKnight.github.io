                <h2>What are owls?</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <!-- An image beside this paragraph -->
                <p>
                    Owls are birds of prey that belong to the order Strigiformes, known for their solitary,
                    nocturnal behaviour. They have sharp talons, binaural hearing and can take silent flights. They
                    feed on mostly small mammals, insects and other birds, with some exceptions hunting fish instead.

                <h3>Features of an owl</h3>
                <p>
                    Besides the aforementioned features, owls also have binocular vision, where their eyes are at the front 
                    of their head, unlike other birds where they typically have their eyes on the sides of their head. Speaking 
                    of their heads, they are shaped like a satellite dish, which helps to collect and focus sound into their 
                    ears. This attributes to their sharp hearing, which allows them to identify prey hidden under foliage or snow.

                <h3>Owl habitats</h3>
                <p>
                    Where can these owls be found? Well, pretty much everywhere! Except for Antarctica because it's too
                    cold. The habitats can range from dense, lush rainforests to open deserts. Different species thrive
                    in different habitats, like the Great Grey Owl, which excels in the snowy, boreal forests of North America.

                <h2>Species of Owls</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many species of owls. They are mainly split into 2 families:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>True Owls (Strigidae)</li>
                    <li>Barn Owls (Tytonidae)</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>True Owls</h3>
                    <p>
                        The true owl family, also known as Strigidae, consists of over 190 species of owls. Here are some 
                        notable species:
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Snowy Owl</h4>
                            <p>
                                A white owl that lives in the Arctic tundra. If you're a fan of Harry Potter, you might've 
                                seen it as Harry's owl! It is distinguised with its white feathers and black spots, with a 
                                height of up to 70cm. It hunts mostly small mammals during the day in the Arctic summer!
                            </p>
                            <!-- An image of a snowy owl beside the paragraph -->

                        <li>
                            <h4>Burrowing Owl</h4>
                            <p>
                                The burrowing owl lives in, well, burrows! Found in North and South America, they live  
                                underground in grasslands and deserts. They are quite active during the day and are 
                                quite the social birds! They also decorate their homes to attract prey!
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Boreal Owl</h4>
                            <p>
                                Similar to the Snowy Owl, they live in northern boreal forests in Canada, Alaska and 
                                Scandivania! They are very, very strictly elusive and nocturnal, so good luck spotting
                                them in the day! They are quite small, about 27cm tall, making this bird species one of 
                                the most difficult to study!
                            </p>
