                <h2>What are owls?</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <!-- An image beside this paragraph -->
                <p>
                    Owls are birds of prey that belong to the order Strigiformes, known for their solitary,
                    nocturnal behaviour. They have sharp talons, binaural hearing and can take silent flights. They
                    feed on mostly small mammals, insects and other birds, with some exceptions hunting fish instead.

                <h3>Features of an owl</h3>
                <p>
                    Besides the aforementioned features, owls also have binocular vision, where their eyes are at the front 
                    of their head, unlike other birds where they typically have their eyes on the sides of their head. Speaking 
                    of their heads, they are shaped like a satellite dish, which helps to collect and focus sound into their 
                    ears. This attributes to their sharp hearing, which allows them to identify prey hidden under foliage or snow.

                <h3>Owl habitats</h3>
                <p>
                    Where can these owls be found? Well, pretty much everywhere! Except for Antarctica because it's too
                    cold. The habitats can range from dense, lush rainforests to open deserts. Different species thrive
                    in different habitats, like the Great Grey Owl, which excels in the snowy, boreal forests of North America.

                <h2>Species of Owls</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many species of owls. They are mainly split into 2 families:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>True Owls (Strigidae)</li>
                    <li>Barn Owls (Tytonidae)</li>
                </ul>
                <article>
                    <h3>True Owls</h3>
                    <p>
                        The true owl family, also known as Strigidae, consists of over 190 species of owls. Here are some 
                        notable species:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Snowy Owl</h4>
                            <p>
                                A white owl that lives in the Arctic tundra. If you're a fan of Harry Potter, you might've 
                                seen it as Harry's owl! It is distinguised with its white feathers and black spots, with a 
                                height of up to 70cm. It hunts mostly small mammals during the day in the Arctic summer!
                            </p>
                            <!-- An image of a snowy owl beside the paragraph -->

                        <li>
                            <h4>Burrowing Owl</h4>
                            <p>
                                The burrowing owl lives in, well, burrows! Found in North and South America, they live  
                                underground in grasslands and deserts. They are quite active during the day and are 
                                quite the social birds! They also decorate their homes to attract prey!
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Boreal Owl</h4>
                            <p>
                                Similar to the Snowy Owl, they live in northern boreal forests in Canada, Alaska and 
                                Scandivania! They are very, very strictly elusive and nocturnal, so good luck spotting
                                them in the day! They are quite small, about 27cm tall, making this bird species one of 
                                the most difficult to study!
                            </p>

                    <h3>Barn Owls</h3>
                    <p>
                        The barn owl or Tytonidae family, unlike the true owl family, has around 20-30 species. They are 
                        distinguished by their heart-shaped faces, and are some of the best nocturnal hunters in the wild!
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Barn Owl</h4>
                            <p>
                                True to its name, the barn owl is of the barn owl family and the most widespread owl in 
                                the world! It has a white, heart-shaped face, equipped with dark eyes, unlike the norm
                                for owls. They are outstandingly silent mid-flight and hunts mostly rodents, being the 
                                perfect assistant for farmers!
                            </p>
                            <!-- An image of a barn owl beside the paragraph-->
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Eastern Grass Owl</h4>
                            <p>
                                Found in Southeast Asia and Australia, this particular barn owl lives amongst the tall 
                                grasslands and marshes. It has a special trait where it makes tunnels in the grass 
                                to avoid being spotted. Its elusive behaviour makes it hard to spot in the wild, 
                                despite what its natural habitats may suggest.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Bay Owl</h4>
                            <p>
                                Bay owls have a staggeringly low number of 2 species, that being the Oriental species and 
                                Sri Lanka species! Unlike normal barn owls, their faces are strongly curved, comparable to 
                                that of a hook, and prefer humid, dense forests, which could be the reason for the difference 
                                in face shape. However, due to their rarity, humans use them as indicators to determine how 
                                healthy a forest is! 
                            </p>

                <h2>Hunting Cycle of Owls</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many interesting details when it comes to owls hunting their prey! Let's have a look!
                </p>
                <article>
                    <h3>Timing the hunt</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most owls, like the barn owl, are nocturnal and use their enchanced night vision and sharp hearing 
                        to hunt during the night, when their prey like rodents and insects are more active. However, there 
                        are some exceptions like the short-eared owl and burrowing owl that hunt during either sunrise or 
                        sunset and in full daylight respectively.

                    <h3>Locating the prey</h3>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to locating prey, owls use their binocular vision and forward-facing eyes that have 
                        retinas tuned to low light levels to find prey. Some owls don't even use vision, and fully rely on 
                        their hearing to locate prey in total darkness, which is supported by their facial discs that funnel 
                        the sound of their surroundings to their ears.

                    <h3>Stalking and approaching the prey</h3>
                    <p>
                        When approaching their next meal, owls use their unique feathers to break turbulence and reduce sound. 
                        This allows them to glide silently to a striking position, often without their prey knowing they're 
                        coming.
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Striking the prey</h3>
                    <p>
                        Owls, being raptors, kill off their prey by using their razor sharp talons instead of their beaks to 
                        pierce through their prey. Not all owls kill off their prey immediately however, because they may choose 
                        to bring them back to their nest and finish the job later on.
