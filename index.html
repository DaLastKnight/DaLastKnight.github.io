                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Owls are birds of prey that belong to the order Strigiformes, known for their solitary,
                        nocturnal behaviour. They have sharp talons, binaural hearing and can take silent flights. They
                        feed on mostly small mammals, insects and other birds, except for some that hunt fish instead.

                    <p>
                        Where can these owls be found? Well, pretty much everywhere! Except for Antarctica because it's too
                        cold. The habitats can range from dense, lush rainforests to open deserts. Different species thrive
                        in different habitats, like the Great Grey Owl, which excels in the snowy, boreal forests of North America.
