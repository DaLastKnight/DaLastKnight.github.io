                <h2>What are owls?</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Owls are birds of prey that belong to the order Strigiformes, known for their solitary,
                    nocturnal behaviour. They have sharp talons, binaural hearing and can take silent flights. They
                    feed on mostly small mammals, insects and other birds, with some exceptions hunting fish instead.
                </p>
                <h3>Features of an owl</h3>
                <p>
                    Besides the aforementioned features, owls also have binocular vision, where their eyes are at the front 
                    of their head, unlike other birds where they typically have their eyes on the sides of their head.
                </p>
                <h3>Owl habitats</h3>
                <p>
                    Where can these owls be found? Well, pretty much everywhere! Except for Antarctica because it's too
                    cold. The habitats can range from dense, lush rainforests to open deserts. Different species thrive
                    in different habitats, like the Great Grey Owl, which excels in the snowy, boreal forests of North America.
